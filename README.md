# SellGUI

`/sell` opens a native transparent Minecraft dialog listing the sellable items in your inventory.
Click an item, type how many to sell (or sell all of it). **Sell All** on the main list sells everything. Prices are set in `plugins/SellGUI/prices.yml`.

Requires **Paper 1.21.7+** (dialog API), **Java 21**, **Vault** + an economy (EssentialsX).

Sell message: `+$<amount>` (the `$` is bright green).

## Build
GitHub Actions builds the jar on every push: open the **Actions** tab -> latest run -> download the `SellGUI` artifact.
Locally: `mvn package` -> `target/SellGUI.jar`.

## Orders (`/order`)
Players can place buy orders: pick an item, an amount and a total price.
The money is taken immediately and refunded if the order is cancelled. Anyone who hands over
the full amount (plain, unnamed items) receives the money; the items go to the order owner
(or are delivered when they next join). Max 5 orders per player. Data is stored in `orders.yml`.
